In the analysis of a bike sales dataset using MS Excel, the project involved the creation of pivot tables to systematically organize and summarize the data. This facilitated a structured examination of various aspects of bike sales. To enhance understanding and insight, charts were generated to visually represent sales trends and patterns within the dataset. The culmination of this effort was the compilation of these charts into a comprehensive dashboard. This dashboard served as a centralized hub for in-depth analysis, offering a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for stakeholders to glean valuable insights from the bike sales data. The combination of pivot tables, charts, and a dashboard in MS Excel provided a powerful toolkit for conducting a thorough and accessible analysis of the bike sales dataset.
